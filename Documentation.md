## Overview

### Conceptual specifications

Pong! is a simple, easy to play mini-game. The player only needs to control Pedal. The aim is to catch the ball and once the ball is not caught, the game is over. The number of balls increases over time and the game becomes more difficult.

The player's score is displayed in the top left corner of the game and the final score is displayed in the centre of the screen at the end of the game.

### Technical Specifications

Development language: **Python 3**

Third-party library: **Pygame, Random**.

The game is designed for 2 classes: **Ball** and **Main**.

Class functionality/Requirements:
- The base class `Ball` is responsible for the storage of ball types. In `class Ball`, main constructor will initialize the ball types: coordinates, position, velocity and size of the ball; sounds including hitting sound and losing sound. Define the way the ball moves: once the ball touches the x-axis, it moves in the -1 direction on the y-axis and vice versa.

- The three types has been specified in class `Type1`, `Type2` and `Type3`. The three types inherit from class `Warehouse`.
